=========

This is an example client for HBM Daq Stream protocol. 

It connects to a HBM Daq Streaming socket, receives everything that arrives, subscribes signals, interpretes meta information and measured data.

The open source project jsoncpp is being used as JSON composer and parser. Some example programs do use Boost libraries. Refer to www.boost.org for details.
